# Advent of Code 2022

More Advent-ures in code, again using Clojure and some preferred libraries for dealing with matrices, graphs, combinatorics, parsing, and so on. I have some grand plans about using some other languages on certain problems, or as an alternative solution, but I'm not sure I will end up doing that very much. BQN is a language of interest, for example, but I'm only going there if an array language will really get me there faster or significantly more elegantly. However, I'm no expert in BQN and I don't want to be writing, say, low-level parsing functions when I have a perfectly good Clojure parser at my fingertips.

I will comment on some of the solutions as I go, but not everything like I've done before.

## Commentary

Days 1 and 2 are gently easing everyone into the game, but even day 2 will be testing the very casual coders to pick a data structure (or not) that captures the rules and scoring. I went with a couple of 3x3 matrices and kept it simple, possibly at the expense of some elegance. But there are no prizes for style in this challenge, it's just stars for right answers.
